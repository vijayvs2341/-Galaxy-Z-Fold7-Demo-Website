🧠 How It Works

The hero section autoplays a low-opacity Samsung video background.

AOS.js animates each section as it enters the viewport.

The carousel cycles through Fold7 videos and images.

The navigation bar dynamically highlights the section currently in view.

Clicking “Pre-order” or “Official Page” opens Samsung’s product site.
